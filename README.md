This project focused on conducting sentiment analysis on Reddit data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Reddit data was collected using the PRAW library, encompassing post titles, authors, scores, full text, and URLs. The collected data underwent preprocessing to ensure accuracy and relevance. Through sentiment analysis, the project aimed to determine the emotional tone within the posts. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provided insights into the distribution of sentiments across the dataset.
